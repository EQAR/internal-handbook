EQAR Internal Handbook
======================

This **Internal Handbook** aims to be a helpful information resource for your work. It targets the Register Committee in particular, but also includes information that will be useful for members of the Executive Board, the Appeals Committee and the Secretariat.

The first version of this Handbook was created in 2010, after EQAR’s first Joint Informal Meeting of committees. The Handbook was revised in 2014 and 2015, in order to take account of changes in EQAR's Procedures for Applications.

The objective of the Handbook is to acquaint “newcomers” on EQAR’s committees with their responsibilities, roles, established procedures and working methods. In addition, it includes all relevant practical information. For existing committee members it should be a practical reference document, which may be consulted from time to time on specific questions.

Any feedback on the current version would be a great help for future revisions: are the right issues addressed, or are important matters missing? What is unnecessarily detailed and what requires more in depth explanation? Is the information straight-forward and easy to understand?

As a small organisation, EQAR can only realise its activities thanks to the invaluable commitment of those who contribute their time and effort as members of its committees. I hope this Handbook will be a useful tool to facilitate your involvement in EQAR.
