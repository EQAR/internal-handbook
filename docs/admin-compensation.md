# Volunteer Compensation

All Register Committee members receive a compensation for their “volunteer contribution” amounting to 1350 EUR per annum. This compensation is intended to compensate for time dedicated to EQAR and fringe expenses (phone, copies, small refreshments etc.) not reimbursed by EQAR.

This amount will be transferred to your account towards the end of the calendar year. For incoming or outgoing RC members, who have contributed to only one or two Register Committee meeting(s) during that particular year, a smaller amount will be paid pro-rata.
